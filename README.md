Please check out [HACKING.md](docs/HACKING.md) and other documents in the docs directory.

## Building packages from source

To get development branch from source control: https://gitlab.com/i2p.plus/I2P.Plus/

### Prerequisites

- Java SDK (preferably Oracle/Sun or OpenJDK) 1.8.0 or higher
  - Non-linux operating systems and JVMs: See https://trac.i2p2.de/wiki/java
  - Certain subsystems for embedded (core, router, mstreaming, streaming, i2ptunnel)
    require only Java 1.6
- Apache Ant 1.9.8 or higher
- The xgettext, msgfmt, and msgmerge tools installed from the GNU gettext package
  http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/
- Build environment must use a UTF-8 locale.

### Ant build process

On x86 systems run the following (this will build using IzPack4):

    ant pkg

On non-x86, use one of the following instead:

    ant installer-linux
    ant installer-freebsd
    ant installer-osx
    ant installer-windows

If you want to build with IzPack5, download from: http://izpack.org/downloads/ and then
install it, and then run the following command(s):

    ant installer5-linux
    ant installer5-freebsd
    ant installer5-osx
    ant installer5-windows

To build an unsigned update for an existing installation, run:

    ant updater

Run 'ant' with no arguments to see other build options.

### Docker
