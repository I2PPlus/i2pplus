    <title>I2P Internal Communication Package</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
    Internal communication interfaces for router and client within
    same JVM, using queues instead of socket-based I2CP.
</p>

<p>
    This package provides:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct message passing between router and client</li>
<li>Queue-based I2CP communication</li>
<li>In-JVM communication optimization</li>
<li>Reduced serialization overhead</li>
</ul>

<p>
    When a router and client are running in the same JVM, this
    package allows them to communicate directly using queues rather than
    serializing messages over socket streams. This provides improved
    performance and reduced overhead compared to standard I2CP communication.
