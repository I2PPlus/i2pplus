<p>
    Time synchronization utilities and interfaces for I2P applications.
</p>

<p>
    This package provides the core time synchronization functionality needed by I2P applications
    to maintain accurate clocks and coordinate timing across the distributed network.
    The full router-specific implementation is now in net.i2p.router.time, while this package
    contains the essential interfaces and utilities that are available to all I2P applications.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Key Components:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time Synchronization:</strong> Interfaces for coordinating time with network peers</li>
<li><strong>Clock Skew Management:</strong> Handling of time differences between routers</li>
<li><strong>NTP Integration:</strong> Network Time Protocol support for accurate timekeeping</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Usage Notes:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Applications should use the interfaces in this package for time-related operations</li>
<li>Router-specific time synchronization implementation is in net.i2p.router.time</li>
<li>Proper time synchronization is critical for I2P's security and performance</li>
</ul>
