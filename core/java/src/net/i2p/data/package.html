<p>
    These classes define the common data structures used by the various I2P protocols.
</p>

<p>
    This package contains the fundamental data structures that form the backbone of I2P's communication protocols, including:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Destination:</strong> Complete I2P destination containing public keys and signing information</li>
<li><strong>LeaseSet:</strong> Routing information for establishing tunnels to destinations</li>
<li><strong>RouterInfo:</strong> Router identification and network contact information</li>
<li><strong>TunnelId:</strong> Unique identifiers for tunnel segments</li>
<li><strong>SessionKey:</strong> Encryption keys for secure communication</li>
<li><strong>Signature:</strong> Digital signatures for authentication and integrity</li>
<li><strong>Certificate:</strong> X.509-style certificates for router identification</li>
</ul>

<p>
    All data structures implement proper serialization and deserialization for network transmission, with built-in validation and type safety. These classes are designed to be immutable where possible and provide efficient memory usage for high-throughput routing operations.
