<p>
    Internal implementation of the I2P client SDK, providing the client
    side of the I2CP protocol for applications communicating through I2P.
</p>

<p>
    This package contains:
</p>
<ul>
<li>I2PSession implementation and management</li>
<li>I2CP protocol message handling</li>
<li>Client connection lifecycle management</li>
<li>Session configuration and state handling</li>
<li>Message sending and receiving logic</li>
</ul>

<p>
    These classes implement the client side of I2CP and are not to be used
    externally. Subject to change and not part of the public API. Moved from
    net.i2p.client in 0.9.21 to separate implementation from interface.
