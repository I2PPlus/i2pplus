</head>
<body>
<p>
    SOCKS protocol implementation providing client and server functionality for proxy operations through I2P.
</p>

<p>
    This package contains the core SOCKS protocol implementation that enables TCP applications
    to route their traffic through the I2P network. Originally part of the i2ptunnel package,
    it was extracted in version 0.9.33 for broader use across I2P applications, including SSLEepGet.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Key Features:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SOCKS 4/4a/5 Support:</strong> Compatible with major SOCKS protocol versions</li>
<li><strong>Client Implementation:</strong> SOCKS client for routing connections through I2P tunnels</li>
<li><strong>Server Implementation:</strong> SOCKS server for exposing I2P services to external applications</li>
<li><strong>Protocol Constants:</strong> Standard SOCKS protocol definitions and message types</li>
<li><strong>Connection Management:</strong> Handling of SOCKS negotiation and data forwarding</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Usage:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>I2P tunnels use this package to provide SOCKS proxy functionality</li>
<li>External applications can connect to I2P SOCKS proxies for anonymous networking</li>
<li>The implementation supports both outbound and inbound SOCKS connections</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> This package provides low-level SOCKS protocol handling.
    For higher-level tunnel management, see the net.i2p.i2ptunnel package.
