<p>
    Core I2P package providing fundamental interfaces, version information, and entry points to essential I2P services.
</p>

<p>
    This package contains the foundational components that form the public API of I2P, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I2PAppContext:</strong> Central context for accessing I2P services and configuration</li>
<li><strong>Version information:</strong> Build version, update checking, and release management</li>
<li><strong>Core interfaces:</strong> Fundamental abstractions used throughout the I2P codebase</li>
<li><strong>Service locators:</strong> Entry points for accessing router and application services</li>
</ul>

<p>
    With a few exceptions, this package and all others in i2p.jar are maintained as a stable API for use by apps, clients, and plugins.
    The classes in this package provide the primary means for external applications to interact with the I2P network.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Key Usage:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Applications should obtain an I2PAppContext to access I2P services</li>
<li>Version checking and update management is handled through this package</li>
<li>Core interfaces define contracts for I2P-compatible implementations</li>
</ul>
