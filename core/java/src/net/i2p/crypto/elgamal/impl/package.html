    <title>ElGamal Implementation Package</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
    Concrete implementations of ElGamal cryptographic keys for I2P.
</p>

<p>
    This package provides the actual implementation classes for ElGamal public and private keys,
    designed for use with the I2P security provider. The implementations are based on
    Bouncy Castle 1.53 and have been modified for I2P's specific requirements.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Key Components:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>ElGamalPublicKey Implementation:</strong> Concrete public key class</li>
    <li><strong>ElGamalPrivateKey Implementation:</strong> Concrete private key class</li>
    <li><strong>Key Encoding:</strong> Support for PKCS#8 and X.509 standard formats</li>
    <li><strong>I2P Integration:</strong> Optimized for I2P security provider usage</li>
</ul>

<p>
    These implementations are used internally by the I2PProvider to provide
    Java Security API compatibility for ElGamal operations throughout the I2P network.
