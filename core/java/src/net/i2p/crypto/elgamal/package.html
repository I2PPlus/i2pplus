<p>
    Implementation of the ElGamal public-key cryptosystem for I2P.
</p>

<p>
    This package provides interfaces and implementations for ElGamal keys and parameters,
    supporting encryption and decryption operations in the I2P network. The ElGamal
    algorithm is used for secure key exchange and encrypted communication within I2P,
    providing confidentiality and authentication for network traffic.
</p>

<p>
    Key components include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>ElGamalPrivateKey and ElGamalPublicKey interfaces defining the key contract</li>
    <li>Concrete implementations supporting PKCS#8 and X.509 encoding standards</li>
    <li>Parameter specifications for key generation and configuration</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Since 0.9.25.
