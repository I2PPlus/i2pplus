<body>
<p>
Core cryptographic primitives and algorithms used throughout I2P.
</p>

<p>
This package provides the fundamental cryptographic building blocks for I2P's
security and privacy features, including:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Asymmetric Encryption:</strong> ElGamal, ECIES, and post-quantum algorithms</li>
<li><strong>Digital Signatures:</strong> DSA, EdDSA, and related signature schemes</li>
<li><strong>Symmetric Encryption:</strong> AES and other block ciphers</li>
<li><strong>Hash Functions:</strong> SHA-256, SHA-3, and cryptographic digests</li>
<li><strong>Key Derivation:</strong> HKDF and other key derivation functions</li>
<li><strong>Random Number Generation:</strong> Cryptographically secure RNG</li>
<li><strong>Mathematical Primitives:</strong> Big integer operations and field arithmetic</li>
</ul>

<p>
All cryptographic operations are designed to provide strong security guarantees
while maintaining performance suitable for high-throughput routing operations.
The implementation follows established cryptographic standards and best practices.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> This package contains low-level cryptographic primitives.
For higher-level I2P-specific cryptographic operations, see the
net.i2p.crypto.eddsa and net.i2p.crypto.x25519 packages.
