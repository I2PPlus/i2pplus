<p>
    Fortuna Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) from GNU Crypto,
    updated and modified for I2P's cryptographic operations.
</p>

<p>
    This package provides:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fortuna PRNG implementation</li>
<li>Multiple entropy sources</li>
<li>Reseed and pool management</li>
<li>Cryptographically secure random generation</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The Fortuna PRNG is a cryptographically secure random number
    generator designed for long-term security. It accumulates entropy
    from multiple sources and automatically reseeds to maintain
    security even if entropy sources are compromised. This modified
    version is optimized for I2P's cryptographic needs.
