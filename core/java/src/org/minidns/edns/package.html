<p>
    EDNS(0) extension mechanisms for DNS.
</p>

<p>
    This package implements the Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS(0)) as defined in RFC 6891. EDNS(0) provides a framework for extending DNS capabilities beyond the original limitations, including larger message sizes, additional record types, and extended flags.
</p>

<p>
    Key features:
</p>

<ul>
<li>EDNS option parsing and serialization</li>
<li>Extended RCODE and flag handling</li>
<li>UDP payload size negotiation</li>
<li>Cookie options for security</li>
<li>NSID and other experimental options</li>
</ul>

<p>
    EDNS(0) is essential for modern DNS operations, particularly for DNSSEC validation and responses that exceed the traditional 512-byte limit.
