</head>
<body>
<p>
    DNS message parsing and serialization.
</p>

<p>
    This package contains the core classes for representing and manipulating DNS protocol messages. It provides both low-level parsing of raw DNS packet data and high-level abstractions for working with DNS messages in a structured way.
</p>

<p>
    Key components:
</p>

<ul>
<li>DNS message structure (header, questions, answers, authority, additional)</li>
<li>Message parsing from wire format</li>
<li>Message serialization to wire format</li>
<li>EDNS(0) extension support</li>
<li>DNS over TCP/UDP transport handling</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The classes in this package form the foundation for all DNS operations in MiniDNS, providing the ability to construct, parse, and validate DNS protocol messages according to RFC 1035 and related specifications.
