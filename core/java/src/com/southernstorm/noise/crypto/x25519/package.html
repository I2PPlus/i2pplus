<p>
    X25519 elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman primitive for Noise
    protocol framework, moved from router to core in 0.9.38.
</p>

<p>
    This package provides:
</p>
<ul>
<li>X25519 key exchange implementation</li>
<li>Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman operations</li>
<li>High-performance key agreement</li>
<li>Integration with Noise protocol framework</li>
</ul>

<p>
    X25519 is a modern elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman function
    providing high-performance key exchange with strong security
    guarantees. It's used in I2P's Noise protocol implementations
    for secure key establishment. Moved to core to make it available
    across I2P components.

<p>
    Since 0.9.38.
