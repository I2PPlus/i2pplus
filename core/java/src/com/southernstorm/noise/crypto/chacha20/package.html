<p>
    ChaCha20 stream cipher primitive for Noise protocol framework,
    moved from router to core in 0.9.39.
</p>

<p>
    This package provides:
</p>
<ul>
<li>ChaCha20 stream cipher implementation</li>
<li>High-performance symmetric encryption</li>
<li>Integration with Noise protocol framework</li>
<li>Secure key scheduling and state management</li>
</ul>

<p>
    ChaCha20 is a modern stream cipher that provides excellent
    performance and security. It's used in I2P's Noise protocol
    implementations for secure key exchange and encrypted transport
    communications. Moved to core to make it available across
    I2P components.

<p>
    Since 0.9.39.
