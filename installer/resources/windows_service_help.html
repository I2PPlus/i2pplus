The I2P+ Windows Service is now installed and should be
running automatically. To manage the service startup
properties, run <code style="color: #171; font-weight: bold;">services.msc</code> from the start menu
or a command line, and then adjust the I2P+ service
accordingly, or <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7657/configservice">configure</a>
from within the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7657/">Router Console</a>.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">
Additionally, shortcuts are provided to stop and start
the service, though in normal operation you should use
the console to stop the service as this will allow the
router to honor its networking obligations before
shutting down or restarting.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the unlikely event the Windows service fails to
install properly, you can run I2P+ as a standard application
via the i2p.exe file in your application folder, usually found
at: <code style="color: #171; font-weight: bold;">C:\Program Files\i2p\</code>
