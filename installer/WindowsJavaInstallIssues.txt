With newer versions of Java (newer than 1.8), or with
alternative Java distrubutions (e.g. AdoptOpenJDK) you
may run into problems running the install.exe file
directly; when attempting to run the installer you may
be told that you need to install Java, or that the
installation is invalid or corrupt.

This is normally easy to overcome by extracting the
install.jar file from the install.exe file, and then
running that instead.. if it doesn't start the installer
on double click, run the following from a command line:
java -jar \path\to\install.jar
