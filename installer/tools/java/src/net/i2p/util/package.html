    Build-time utilities for I2P translation status reporting and analysis.
</p>

<p>
    Contains tools to analyze and report on the completeness of translations across I2P modules. These utilities scan compiled resources (jars and wars) to generate comprehensive translation status reports in both HTML and text formats.
</p>

<p>
    The main functionality includes loading ResourceBundles from various I2P components, calculating translation percentages, and generating detailed reports showing which languages are complete or missing translations for each resource bundle.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Warning:</strong> This package contains build-time tools only and is not part of the runtime API.
    Subject to change.
    Not for public use.
