<p>
    QR code decoding implementation.
</p>

<p>
    This package provides decoding functionality for QR codes, including pattern recognition, data extraction, and error correction. It implements complex algorithms required to reliably read QR codes from images even when they are damaged or partially obscured.
</p>

<p>
    Components include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Finder pattern detection</li>
<li>Alignment pattern recognition</li>
<li>Timing pattern extraction</li>
<li>Error correction processing</li>
<li>Data bit stream reconstruction</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The decoder handles various QR code versions and error correction levels, ensuring reliable extraction of embedded data for use in I2P applications.
