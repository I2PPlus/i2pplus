    for nonstandard QR Codes that don't use ISO-8859-1

0.4.5 (22 Feb 2008)
  - Checked in first minimal working Blackberry client. Still quite crude.
  - Fixed UTF-8 detection again
  - Refactored Reed-Solomon to allow different GF(256) primitive polynomials,
    in preparation for Data Matrix

  - Supports "URLTO" data in barcodes.
  - Restructured ParsedReaderResult parsing code to not use so many
    exceptions, for more efficiency.

    BarcodeFormat instance
  - More intelligent handling of POSSIBLE_FORMATS decoding hint
  - Fixed sub-optimal handling of EAN-13 barcodes which encode a string

    codes from the MultiFormatReader.

    contain the whole image
  - "Try harder" mode tries 2D formats first to avoid false positives
    in detailed search for 1D codes, in some cases
  - More aggressive inlining by ProGuard, notable performance boost
  - Small Reed-Solomon optimizations for 0- and 1-error case

  - Significant work on Android clients, including UI overhaul and
    continuous scan mode
  - Bug fix: ResultPoints from 1D barcodes were wrong
