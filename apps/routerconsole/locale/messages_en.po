msgstr ""

msgid "A tunnel filter can provide protection against denial of service attacks, without otherwise interrupting the service for genuine users, either in conjunction with the tunnel throttler or as an alternative strategy. It can also be used to log access to a hosted service to determine if the server is under attack, or simply to log all visitors by I2P destination. Additionally, a filter can function simultaneously as a whitelist and blacklist making it more flexible than the Tunnel Manager's access list controls.

msgid "If you want your site to feel responsive, image compression is essential when hosting large images. Using a service like <a href=https://tinypng.com/ target=_blank class='sitelink external'>tinypng.com</a> to compress your png and jpeg images will often result in much smaller files with minimal loss of quality. In some situations the webp format can best jpegs, generating smaller files with approximately the same or better visual fidelity, and has wide browser support. Also consider using svgs instead of bitmaps for icons and illustrations - they're often smaller than the equivalent bitmap file (run them through a service like <a href=https://vecta.io/nano target=_blank class='sitelink external'>Nano SVG Optimizer</a> to remove unneeded cruft), scale without loss of quality, and can be gzipped by your webserver."
msgstr ""

msgid "Use separate files for multi-use assets"
msgstr ""

msgid "Wherever possible, assets that are used repeatedly on your site should be loaded from an external file and not inlined. If you're using the same CSS on several pages, create a separate css file and load that in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of your pages. This will make styling updates to your site easier to manage, and will also allow the file to be cached in the visitor's browser, resulting in less bandwidth demands on your webserver and faster page loads for your visitors."
msgstr ""

msgid "Consider using a backend cache"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you're running a dynamic site handling a large number of concurrent users, content caching can often improve the time taken to deliver pages. For content that rapidly changes, a <a href=https://blog.stackpath.com/glossary-micro-caching/ target=_blank class='sitelink external'>micro-caching strategy</a> may still yield some benefits. The <a href=https://www.nginx.com/ target=_blank class='sitelink external'>Nginx webserver</a> provides a competent caching sub-system, or for a more heavy-weight solution, have a look at <a href=https://varnish-cache.org/ target=_blank class='sitelink external'>Varnish</a>."

msgid "Using an alternative webserver"
msgstr ""

msgid "To configure an alternative webserver for use on I2P, you can either use the existing webserver tunnel and <a href=/configclients>disable the default webserver</a> from running, or create a new HTTP Server tunnel in the <a href=/i2ptunnelmgr>Tunnel Manager</a>. Ensure that the webserver's <i>listening port</i> is also configured in the Tunnel Manager settings. For example, if your webserver is listening by default on address 127.0.0.1 port 80, you'd also need to ensure that the <i>Target port</i> in the Tunnel Manager settings page for the service is also configured to port 80."
msgstr ""

msgid "To preserve anonymity, make sure that the webserver is not publicly available outside of the I2P network, which is normally achieved by configuring the webserver to listen on localhost (127.0.0.1) rather than all interfaces (0.0.0.0)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Be aware that a poorly configured webserver or web appplication can leak information such as your real IP address or server details that may reduce your anonymity or assist a hacker.
