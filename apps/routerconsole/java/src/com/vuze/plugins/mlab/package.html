    Integration layer for running the M-Lab Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT)
    within the I2P router console. See package edu.internet2.ndt for the
    main NDT implementation.

    tool, enabling network performance testing and diagnostics. The integration
    uses a Swing emulation layer to run the applet-based NDT tool in the console.
