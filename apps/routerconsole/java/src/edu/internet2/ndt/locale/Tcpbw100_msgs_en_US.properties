packetQueuing = Packet queuing
packetQueuingInfo = TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) reliably transfers data between two\n Internet hosts.  It automatically detects and recovers from errors and\n losses.  TCP uses buffers to provide this reliability.  In addition,\n switches and routers use buffers to handle cases where multiple input\n links send packets to a single output link or link speeds change\n (FastEthernet to DSL modem).\n\n The NDT server generates and sends 10 seconds of data to the client.  In\n some cases the server can generate data faster than it can send packets\n into the network (e.g., a 2 GHz CPU sending to a DSL connected client).\n When this happens, some packets may remain in the server output queue\n when the 10 second timer expires.  TCP will automatically continue to\n send these queued packets and the client will continue to accept and\n process these incoming packets.  This will result in the client test\n running longer than expected.\n\n This condition has occurred during this test.  No action is required to\n resolve this issue.
