/* This class has code taken from:
 * http://nerds.palmdrive.net/useragent/code.html
 *
 * Class used to obtain information about who is accessing a web-server.
 *
 * When a web browser accesses a web-server, it usually transmits a "User-Agent" string.
 * This is expected to include the name and versions of the browser and the underlying Operating System.
 * Though the information inside a user-agent string is not restricted to these alone, currently,
 * NDT uses this to get Browser OS only.
