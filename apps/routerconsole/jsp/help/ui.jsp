However, if you experience a tunnel failure, all your services will go offline at the same time, so in some scenarios you may wish to configure client services to use their own set of tunnels. This can be done by unchecking the <i>Share tunnels with other clients&hellip;</i> option listed under <i>Shared Clients</i> on the configuration page of the relevant client service in the Tunnel Manager, after which you will need to restart the client service from the <a href='/i2ptunnelmgr'>main Tunnel Manager page</a>.")%></p>
