<p>
    Address book application for fetching and maintaining I2P host
    databases from subscription sources.
</p>

<p>
    This package provides:
</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTP-based subscription fetching</li>
<li>Hosts.txt file parsing and processing</li>
<li>Local database management</li>
<li>Incremental updates and conflict resolution</li>
<li>Background update daemon</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The addressbook application fetches hosts.txt files from configured
    subscription URLs via HTTP, processes them, and adds new hosts to the
    local BlockfileNamingService database. While implemented as a webapp,
    this application contains no user interface itself. May also be packaged
    as a jar for Android. The webapp named 'addressbook' in the
    console is actually SusiDNS.
