    Skip list data structure implementation.
</p>

<p>
    This package provides a skip list implementation, which is a probabilistic data structure that allows fast search, insertion, and deletion operations. Skip lists provide an alternative to balanced trees with similar performance characteristics but simpler implementation.
</p>

<p>
    Features include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>O(log n) average case performance</li>
<li>Concurrent access support</li>
<li>Memory-efficient implementation</li>
<li>Thread-safe operations</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The skip list is used in the address book for maintaining sorted collections of data with efficient lookup capabilities.
