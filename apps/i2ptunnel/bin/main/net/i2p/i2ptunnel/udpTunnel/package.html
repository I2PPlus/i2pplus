<p>
    UDP tunnel implementation for I2PTunnel.
</p>

<p>
    This package provides UDP tunneling functionality for I2PTunnel, allowing UDP-based applications to communicate over the I2P network. It handles the conversion between UDP packets and I2P messages, maintaining the semantics of UDP communication while providing I2P's anonymity and privacy benefits.
</p>

<p>
    Features include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>UDP packet encapsulation in I2P messages</li>
<li>Connection tracking and state management</li>
<li>Port mapping and forwarding</li>
<li>Performance optimization for real-time traffic</li>
<li>Error handling and packet loss recovery</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This enables applications like VoIP, online gaming, and other UDP-based services to operate securely over I2P.
