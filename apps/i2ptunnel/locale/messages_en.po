msgid "The first thing to decide is whether you want to create a server or a client tunnel."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you need to connect to a remote service, such as an IRC server inside I2P or a code repository, then you will require a CLIENT tunnel."
msgstr ""

msgid "On the other hand, if you wish to host a service for others to connect to you'll need to create a SERVER tunnel."

msgid "Server Tunnel"
msgstr ""

msgid "Client Tunnel"
msgstr ""

msgid "There are several types of tunnels to choose from:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Basic tunnel for connecting to a single service inside I2P."
msgstr ""

msgid "Try this if none of the tunnel types below fit your requirements, or you don't know what type of tunnel you need."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tunnel that acts as an HTTP proxy for reaching eepsites inside I2P."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set your browser to use this tunnel as an http proxy, or set your \"http_proxy\" environment variable for command-line applications in GNU/Linux."
msgstr ""

msgid "Websites outside I2P can also be reached if an HTTP proxy within I2P is known."
msgstr ""

msgid "Customised client tunnel specific for IRC connections."
msgstr ""

msgid "With this tunnel type, your IRC client will be able to connect to an IRC network inside I2P."
msgstr ""

msgid "Each IRC network in I2P that you wish to connect to will require its own tunnel. (See Also, SOCKS IRC)"
msgstr ""

msgid "A tunnel that implements the SOCKS protocol."
msgstr ""

msgid "This enables both TCP and UDP connections to be made through a SOCKS outproxy within I2P."
msgstr ""

msgid "A client tunnel implementing the SOCKS protocol, which is customised for connecting to IRC networks."
msgstr ""

msgid "With this tunnel type, IRC networks in I2P can be reached by typing the I2P address into your IRC client, and configuring the IRC client to use this SOCKS tunnel."
msgstr ""

msgid "This means that only one I2P tunnel is required rather than a separate tunnel per IRC network."
msgstr ""

msgid "IRC networks outside I2P can also be reached if a SOCKS outproxy within I2P is known, though it depends on whether or not the outproxy has been blocked by the IRC network."
msgstr ""

msgid "A basic server tunnel for hosting a generic service inside I2P."
msgstr ""

msgid "A server tunnel that is customised for HTTP connections."
msgstr ""

msgid "Use this tunnel type if you want to host an eepsite."
msgstr ""

msgid "A customised server tunnel for hosting IRC networks inside I2P."
msgstr ""

msgid "Usually, a separate tunnel needs to be created for each IRC server that is to be accessible inside I2P."
msgstr ""

msgid "Select tunnel type"
msgstr ""

msgid "Choose a name and description for your tunnel."
msgstr ""

msgid "These can be anything you want - they are just for ease of identifying the tunnel in the routerconsole."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you know of any outproxies for this type of tunnel (either HTTP or SOCKS), fill them in below."
msgstr ""

msgid "Separate multiple proxies with commas."
msgstr ""

msgid "List of I2P outproxy destinations, separated with commas (e.g. proxy1.i2p,proxy2.i2p)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Type in the I2P destination of the service that this client tunnel should connect to."
msgstr ""

msgid "This could be the full Base64 destination key, or an I2P URL from your address book."
msgstr ""

msgid "Enter a b64 or .i2p address here"
msgstr ""

msgid "This is the IP that your service is running on, this is usually on the same machine so 127.0.0.1 is autofilled."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is the port that the service is accepting connections on."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is the port that the client tunnel will be accessed from locally."
msgstr ""

msgid "How do you want this tunnel to be accessed? By just this machine, your entire subnet, or external internet?"
msgstr ""

msgid "You will most likely want to just allow 127.0.0.1"
msgstr ""

msgid "The I2P router can automatically start this tunnel for you when the router is started."
msgstr ""

msgid "This can be useful for frequently-used tunnels (especially server tunnels), but for tunnels that are only used occasionally it would mean that the I2P router is creating and maintaining unnecessary tunnels."
msgstr ""

msgid "The wizard has now collected enough information to create your tunnel."
msgstr ""

msgid "Upon clicking the Save button below, the wizard will set up the tunnel, and take you back to the main I2PTunnel page."
msgstr ""

msgid "Because you chose to automatically start the tunnel when the router starts, you don't have to do anything further."
msgstr ""

msgid "The router will start the tunnel once it has been set up."
msgstr ""

msgid "Because you chose not to automatically start the tunnel, you will have to manually start it."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can do this by clicking the Start button on the main page which corresponds to the new tunnel."
msgstr ""

msgid "Below is a summary of the options you chose:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Tunnel description"
msgstr ""

msgid "Binding address"
msgstr ""

msgid "Tunnel port"
msgstr ""

msgid "Alongside these basic settings, there are a number of advanced options for tunnel configuration."
msgstr ""

msgid "The wizard will set reasonably sensible default values for these, but you can view and/or edit these by clicking on the tunnel's name in the main I2PTunnel page."
