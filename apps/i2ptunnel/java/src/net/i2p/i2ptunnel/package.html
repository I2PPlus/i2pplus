    <title>I2P Tunnel Package</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
    Implementation of preconfigured tunnels for both clients and servers, with a comprehensive UI for tunnel management and configuration.
    Includes special-purpose tunnels for IRC, SOCKS, HTTP, and standard client/server tunnels.
</p>

<p>
    This package provides the core tunneling infrastructure that allows external applications
    to communicate through the I2P network. It supports various tunnel types including:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Client Tunnels:</strong> Allow external applications to connect to I2P destinations</li>
<li><strong>Server Tunnels:</strong> Expose local services to the I2P network</li>
<li><strong>HTTP Tunnels:</strong> Web proxy and server tunneling for browsers</li>
<li><strong>SOCKS Tunnels:</strong> Generic SOCKS proxy for TCP applications</li>
<li><strong>IRC Tunnels:</strong> Specialized tunneling for IRC clients</li>
<li><strong>Streamr Tunnels:</strong> Bidirectional streaming tunnels</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The entry point is TunnelControllerGroup, which is started from clients.config. 
    Individual tunnel configuration is stored in i2ptunnel.config. 
    The primary API consists of TunnelControllerGroup and TunnelController. 
    Other classes may not be maintained as a stable API.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Key Components:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>TunnelControllerGroup - Manages collections of tunnels</li>
<li>TunnelController - Controls individual tunnel lifecycle</li>
<li>TunnelManager - Handles tunnel creation and configuration</li>
<li>Various tunnel implementations for different protocols</li>
</ul>
