<p>
The SAM (Simple Anonymous Messaging) client API.
</p>
<p>
SAM provides a bridge between I2P applications and the I2P router, allowing
applications written in any language to communicate over I2P without needing
to implement the full I2P protocol. This package contains the SAM server
implementation that handles client connections and protocol commands.
</p>
<p>
Key features:
<ul>
<li>Protocol-agnostic communication bridge</li>
<li>Support for streaming, datagram, and raw messaging</li>
<li>Session management and client authentication</li>
<li>Automatic destination generation and management</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The SAM protocol specification is available in the I2P documentation.
