    <title>I2P Router Data Structures Package</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
    Router-specific data structures and identity management classes for I2P.
</p>

<p>
    This package contains core data structures that are used exclusively by the I2P router for managing router identities, addresses, and cryptographic operations. These classes were moved from the general net.i2p.data package to separate router-specific functionality from client-facing APIs.
</p>

<p><b>Key Components:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>RouterAddress - Represents a router's transport address and configuration</li>
<li>RouterIdentity - Contains a router's cryptographic identity and signing keys</li>
<li>RouterInfo - Complete router information including addresses and capabilities</li>
<li>RouterKeyGenerator - Generates cryptographic keys for router operations</li>
<li>RouterPrivateKeyFile - Manages storage and access to router private keys</li>
<li>SortHelper - Utilities for sorting and organizing router data</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Main Functionality:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Router identity and address management</li>
<li>Cryptographic key generation and storage</li>
<li>Router information serialization and deserialization</li>
<li>Network address configuration and transport options</li>
<li>Router capability and feature advertisement</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Usage Notes:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>These classes are for internal router use only</li>
<li>Client applications should use higher-level APIs instead</li>
<li>RouterInfo is the primary data structure exchanged between routers</li>
<li>RouterIdentity provides the foundation for router authentication</li>
</ul>
