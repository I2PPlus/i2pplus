    <title>I2P NTCP Transport Package</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
    The NTCP (New TCP) transport for I2P, allowing I2P messages to be passed
    over TCP connections. NTCP replaces an older TCP transport that had congestion
    issues.
</p>

<p>
    This package provides:
</p>
<ul>
<li>TCP-based peer connections</li>
<li>Reliable ordered delivery of I2P messages</li>
<li>Transport establishment and authentication</li>
<li>Connection management and pooling</li>
<li>Network address translation (NAT) support</li>
</ul>

<p>
    NTCP is one of the primary transport protocols used by I2P, providing
    reliable communication suitable for environments where UDP may be blocked
    or filtered.
