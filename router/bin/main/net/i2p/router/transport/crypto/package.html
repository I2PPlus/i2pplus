<body>
<p>
    Cryptographic operations for I2P transport protocols, including key exchange
    algorithms, session key management, and transport-layer encryption.
</p>

<p>
    This package provides:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Diffie-Hellman key exchange for transport establishment</li>
<li>Session key generation and management</li>
<li>Transport-specific encryption implementations</li>
<li>Cryptographic material for NTCP and SSU transports</li>
<li>Key agreement protocols for peer authentication</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Essential for establishing secure, authenticated communication channels
    between I2P routers over various transport protocols.
