    Compatibility classes for integrating with CyberGarage UPnP
    library, imported from Freenet project.
</p>

<p>
    This package provides:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Interface adapters for UPnP library</li>
<li>Compatibility shims for I2P integration</li>
<li>UPnP protocol helper classes</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Small classes used by net.i2p.transport.UPnP to interface
    with org.cybergarage UPnP library. These classes were
    imported from the Freenet project to enable UPnP support
    for NAT traversal in I2P, providing the necessary glue code
    between I2P's transport system and the CyberGarage UPnP
    framework.
