<p>
    The cybergarage cyberlink UPnP library version 3.0, with minor mods for I2P.
</p>

<p>
    This package contains the CyberLink UPnP library, which provides Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) functionality for automatic network device discovery and configuration. In I2P, this library is used to:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Automatically configure port forwarding on UPnP-enabled routers</li>
<li>Detect network topology and gateway devices</li>
<li>Facilitate peer-to-peer connectivity through NAT traversal</li>
<li>Improve network accessibility for I2P services</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The I2P-specific modifications ensure compatibility with I2P's networking requirements while maintaining the core UPnP functionality. This helps users achieve better connectivity with minimal manual configuration.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> UPnP functionality is optional and can be disabled in the router configuration for users who prefer manual port configuration or have security concerns about UPnP.
