 * Then call {@link org.apache.commons.net.DatagramSocketClient#close close} to close the connection properly. Unlike
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.time.TimeTCPClient}, successive calls to {@link #getTime getTime} or {@link #getDate getDate} are permitted without
 * re-establishing a connection. That is because UDP is a connectionless protocol and the Time protocol is stateless.
