/**
 * The WhoisClient class implements the client side of the Internet Whois Protocol defined in RFC 954. To query a host you create a WhoisClient instance,
 * connect to the host, query the host, and finally disconnect from the host. If the whois service you want to query is on a non-standard port, connect to the
 * host at that port. Here's a sample use:
 *
 * <pre>
 * WhoisClient whois;
 *
 * whois = new WhoisClient();
 *
 * try {
 *     whois.connect(WhoisClient.DEFAULT_HOST);
 *     System.out.println(whois.query("foobar"));
 *     whois.disconnect();
 * } catch (IOException e) {
 *     System.err.println("Error I/O exception: " + e.getMessage());
 *     return;
 * }
 * </pre>
