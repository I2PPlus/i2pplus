/**
 * The CharGenTCPClient class is a TCP implementation of a client for the character generator protocol described in RFC 864. It can also be used for Systat (RFC
 * 866), Quote of the Day (RFC 865), and netstat (port 15). All of these protocols involve connecting to the appropriate port, and reading data from an input
 * stream. The chargen protocol actually sends data until the receiving end closes the connection. All the others send only a fixed amount of data and then
 * close the connection.
 * <p>
 * To use the CharGenTCPClient class, just establish a connection with {@link org.apache.commons.net.SocketClient#connect connect} and call
 * {@link #getInputStream getInputStream()} to access the data. Don't close the input stream when you're done with it. Rather, call
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.SocketClient#disconnect disconnect} to clean up properly.
