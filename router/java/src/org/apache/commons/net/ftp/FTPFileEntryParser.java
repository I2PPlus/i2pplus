/**
 * FTPFileEntryParser defines the interface for parsing a single FTP file listing and converting that information into an
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTPFile} instance. Sometimes you will want to parse unusual listing formats, in which case you would create your own
 * implementation of FTPFileEntryParser and if necessary, subclass FTPFile.
 * <p>
 * Here are some examples showing how to use one of the classes that implement this interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The first example uses the {@code FTPClient.listFiles()} API to pull the whole list from the subfolder {@code subfolder} in one call, attempting to
 * automatically detect the parser type. This method, without a parserKey parameter, indicates that autodection should be used.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * FTPClient f = FTPClient();
 * f.connect(server);
 * f.login(user, password);
 * FTPFile[] files = f.listFiles("subfolder");
 * </pre>
 *
 * The second example uses the {@code FTPClient.listFiles()} API to pull the whole list from the current working directory in one call, but specifying by
 * class name the parser to be used. For this particular parser class, this approach is necessary since there is no way to autodetect this server type.
 *
 * <pre>
 * FTPClient f = FTPClient();
 * f.connect(server);
 * f.login(user, password);
 * FTPFile[] files = f.listFiles("org.apache.commons.net.ftp.parser.EnterpriseUnixFTPFileEntryParser", ".");
 * </pre>
 *
 * The third example uses the {@code FTPClient.listFiles()} API to pull a single file listing in an arbitrary directory in one call, specifying by KEY the
 * parser to be used, in this case, VMS.
 *
 * <pre>
 * FTPClient f = FTPClient();
 * f.connect(server);
 * f.login(user, password);
 * FTPFile[] files = f.listFiles("VMS", "subfolder/foo.java");
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * For an alternative approach, see the {@link FTPListParseEngine} class which provides iterative access.
 * </p>
