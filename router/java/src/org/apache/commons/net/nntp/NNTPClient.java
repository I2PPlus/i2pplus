/**
 * NNTPClient encapsulates all the functionality necessary to post and retrieve articles from an NNTP server. As with all classes derived from
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.SocketClient}, you must first connect to the server with {@link org.apache.commons.net.SocketClient#connect connect} before
 * doing anything, and finally {@link org.apache.commons.net.nntp.NNTP#disconnect disconnect()} after you're completely finished interacting with the server.
 * Remember that the {@link org.apache.commons.net.nntp.NNTP#isAllowedToPost isAllowedToPost()} method is defined in {@link org.apache.commons.net.nntp.NNTP}.
 * <p>
 * You should keep in mind that the NNTP server may choose to prematurely close a connection if the client has been idle for longer than a given time period or
 * if the server is being shutdown by the operator or some other reason. The NNTP class will detect a premature NNTP server connection closing when it receives
 * a {@link org.apache.commons.net.nntp.NNTPReply#SERVICE_DISCONTINUED NNTPReply.SERVICE_DISCONTINUED} response to a command. When that occurs, the NNTP class
 * method encountering that reply will throw an {@link org.apache.commons.net.nntp.NNTPConnectionClosedException} . {@code NNTPConectionClosedException} is
 * a subclass of {@code IOException} and therefore need not be caught separately, but if you are going to catch it separately, its catch block must
 * appear before the more general {@code IOException} catch block. When you encounter an
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.nntp.NNTPConnectionClosedException} , you must disconnect the connection with
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.nntp.NNTP#disconnect disconnect()} to properly clean up the system resources used by NNTP. Before disconnecting, you may check
 * the last reply code and text with {@link org.apache.commons.net.nntp.NNTP#getReplyCode getReplyCode} and
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.nntp.NNTP#getReplyString getReplyString}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Rather than list it separately for each method, we mention here that every method communicating with the server and throwing an IOException can also throw a
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.MalformedServerReplyException} , which is a subclass of IOException. A MalformedServerReplyException will be thrown when the
 * reply received from the server deviates enough from the protocol specification that it cannot be interpreted in a useful manner despite attempts to be as
 * lenient as possible.
 * </p>
