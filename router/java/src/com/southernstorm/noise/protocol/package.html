Noise Protocol Framework protocol patterns and state machines.
</p>
<p>
This package contains the high-level protocol patterns and state machines
for the Noise Protocol Framework. It defines the various handshake patterns
and manages the protocol state throughout the secure communication process.
</p>
<p>
Components include:
<ul>
<li>Handshake pattern definitions</li>
<li>Protocol state machines</li>
<li>Message processing and generation</li>
<li>Transport layer integration</li>
<li>Error handling and validation</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
These patterns provide the foundation for secure key exchange and encrypted
communication in I2P, offering various security properties and performance
characteristics suitable for different use cases.
