/**
 * The StartupJob should be run once on router startup to initialize the system
 * and set things in motion.  This task loads the router configuration and then
 * queues up a LoadRouterInfoJob, which reads the old RouterInfo structure from
 * a previously saved version on disk.  If it can't find one, it fires up a
 * CreateRouterInfoJob which builds a new one from scratch, including a new
 * RouterIdentity and then reruns the LoadRouterInfoJob.  After that the
 * router begins listening on its ports by running the BootCommSystemJob which
 * is followed by the BootNetworkDbJob, though BuildTrustedLinksJob may occur
 * as well.  After running the BootNetworkDbJob, the final
 * StartAcceptingClientsJob is queued up, which finishes the startup.
