<body>
<p>
    Interface for classes to be started and stopped via clients.config.
    Classes implementing the RouterApp interface will be controlled with
    that interface instead of being started with main().
</p>

<p>
    The benefits for clients using this interface:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Get the current context via the constructor</li>
<li>Complete life cycle management by the router</li>
<li>Avoid the need for static references</li>
<li>Ability to find other clients without using static references</li>
</ul>
