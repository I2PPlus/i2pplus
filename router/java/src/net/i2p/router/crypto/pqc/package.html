Post-quantum cryptographic algorithms for I2P.
</p>
<p>
This package provides implementations of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms
designed to resist attacks from quantum computers. These algorithms are
intended for future-proofing I2P's cryptographic infrastructure against
advances in quantum computing.
</p>
<p>
Supported algorithms include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Lattice-based cryptography (Kyber, Dilithium)</li>
<li>Code-based cryptography</li>
<li>Hash-based signatures</li>
  <li>Multivariate cryptography</li>
</ul>
