    <title>I2P Router Crypto Ratchet Package</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
    Implementation of ECIES-X25519-AEAD-Ratchet cryptographic protocol
    (I2P proposal 144), providing forward secrecy and enhanced security
    for I2P transport communications.
</p>

<p>
    This package provides:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Double ratchet algorithm implementation</li>
<li>X25519 key exchange integration</li>
<li>AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data)</li>
<li>ECIES (Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme)</li>
<li>Key derivation and rotation</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The ratchet protocol provides forward secrecy by regularly rotating
    encryption keys, ensuring that compromising long-term keys does not
    compromise past communications. This implementation follows proposal 144
    for integrating ECIES with X25519 and AEAD.
</p>

<p>
    Since 0.9.44. Subject to change, not a public API, not for external use.
