/**
 * Count how often we have accepted a tunnel with the peer
 * as the previous or next hop.
 * We limit each peer to a percentage of all participating tunnels,
 * subject to minimum and maximum values for the limit.
 *
 * This offers basic protection against simple attacks
 * but is not a complete solution, as by design, we don't know
 * the originator of a tunnel request.
 *
 * This also effectively limits the number of tunnels between
 * any given pair of routers, which probably isn't a bad thing.
 *
 * Note that the actual limits will be higher than specified
 * by up to 1 / LIFETIME_PORTION because the counter window resets.
 *
 * Note that the counts are of previous + next hops, so the total will
 * be higher than the participating tunnel count, and will also grow
 * as the network uses more 3-hop tunnels.
