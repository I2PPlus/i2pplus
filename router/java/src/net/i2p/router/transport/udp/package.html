<body>
<p>
    The UDP transport (also known as 'SSU' or Secure Semi-reliable UDP transport)
    for I2P, allowing I2P messages to be passed over UDP connections.
</p>

<p>
    This package provides:
</p>
<ul>
<li>UDP-based peer connections</li>
<li>Secure semi-reliable message delivery</li>
<li>NAT traversal capabilities</li>
<li>Introduction and rendezvous protocols</li>
<li>Faster peer discovery compared to TCP</li>
</ul>

<p>
    SSU is optimized for firewall and NAT traversal, making it ideal for
    routers behind restrictive network configurations. It provides improved
    performance for peer discovery and connectivity in challenging network
    environments.
