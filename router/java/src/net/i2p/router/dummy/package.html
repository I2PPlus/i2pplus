<p>
    Dummy implementations and stub classes for testing purposes.
</p>

<p>
    This package provides:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Mock implementations of router components</li>
<li>Testing stubs for development</li>
<li>Fake data generators</li>
<li>Simplified versions of complex classes</li>
</ul>

<p>
    These dummy classes are used in unit tests and development
    to isolate components and avoid dependencies on full router
    infrastructure. They provide minimal implementations sufficient
    for testing specific functionality.
